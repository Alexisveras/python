# What is Python?

Python is a general purpose, high level, interpreted, interactive, object oriented computer programming language use to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python was created  by Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum in 1985-1990. Then was released in 1991. The inspiration for the name came from BBCâ€™sTV show  

Python is an interpreted programming language, This means that it has an interpreter to execute the programme directly, In fact, Python was develop to eventually be as understandable and clear as plain English. Its language is open source, which means that anyone can contribute to it.

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.



## How to learn Python?
You can start with Hello World program. Break the program into its elements and then study and examine each of them. Go through the topics one by one and keep on practicing. Remember, practice is the key to programming. a good app to learn a get a free certificate is [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/learn/python)

## Why learn Python?
Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages right now. It is especially used for data science and machine learning endeavors. At present, there are more than a few opportunities for Python developers. Besides, it is very easy to learn.


## Is Python a good language to learn first?
Where can I learn Python?
How long does it take to learn Python?
Any programming language has two aspects; the syntax, and the library. While the former might require only a few days to learn, the latter is a life-long learning task. However, you can get started with Python professionally after 6 to 7 months of dedicated practice. You can learn Python even without a programming background. However, it is surely a good thing if you first learn the basic programming terminology.
