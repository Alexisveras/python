# History of Python

## Python’s Creator
Python was created by Guido van Rossum who is a Dutch programmer. He was also known as the "Benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) for python, until he stepped down from the position in July 2018. He Worked at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and contributed a glob() routine to BSD Unix during 1986 and helped develop the ABC programming language. But later during December 1989, he was looking for a hobby project around the time in Christmas and started working on a new interpreter for a new language. He later named this language as Python after choosing the word form a TV serial named Monty Python's Flying Circus. He admits that ABC language is the predecessor of Python language. The first release of the language was done in 1991.

## Python’s Appeal
Python’s strength as a new language was how easy it was to extend it support multiple platfroms. It is capable of communicating with different file formats and libraries. Van Rossum also aimed for making it a programming language for everybody. So the language’s design is simple yet powerful. As it grew in popularity and adoption, the major release of version 2.0 was done in 2000. Python moved its repository to SourceForge and granted public access to its version controlsystem. SO more people could participate in its development and testing. The version progressed to 2.7 in July 2010 and stopped from further enhancements. This version is planned to be supported till end of 2020.
